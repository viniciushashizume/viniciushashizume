## üéì Academic Projects
*Here are some of the projects I've developed during my academic journey.*

| Project | Description | Technologies Used |
|---|---|---|
| **[Feeder Monitoring System with AI Integration](https://github.com/viniciushashizume/Projeto-Alimentador-LABRIOT-2)** | An ESP8266 IoT device that monitors the feed levels in UTFPR's feeders, integrated with AI technologies to determine peak feeding times. | `C++`, `Arduino`, `MQTT`, `Node-Red`, `Python`, `Pytorch`, `Flask`|
| **[Application of AI Techniques in the PACMAN Game](https://github.com/viniciushashizume/Cidades-Inteligentes---Pacman)** | Using the GameMaker platform, heuristic search algorithms (A* and Greedy Search) were implemented with specific heuristics for the ghosts' behavior. | `Game Maker Language` |
| **[Parser and Lexer Implementation](https://github.com/viniciushashizume/Compiladores-T1)** | A lexical and syntactic analyzer for a Basic Programming Language, a language inspired by an advanced calculator but extended with control structures (FOR) and logical operators (AND, OR). | `Flex`, `Bison`, `C` |
| **[Airline Management System Prototype](https://github.com/viniciushashizume/ProjetoIHC)** | A prototype created based on "Human-Computer Interaction" guidelines. | `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` |

## üíª Personal Projects
*These are some of the projects I've created on my own to practice and explore new technologies.*

| Project | Description | Technologies Used |
|---|---|---|
| **[Steam Dashboard](https://github.com/viniciushashizume/SteamDashboard)** | Dashboard for analyzing Steam profiles. It allows searching for users by both their numeric ID and their name (vanity URL), displaying profile information, general statistics, and an interactive chart with the 10 most played games. The application's back-end was developed in TypeScript to manage the Steam API's functionality, and the front-end was built with React and Vite (using Tailwind CSS).|`React`, `Typescript`, `Vite`, `Tailwind CSS`|
